The JobsNotGuns Summit will provide an opportunity for employers to present their barriers to hiring district residents and residents will share their challenges for obtaining employment or a track for long-term career opportunities. A questionnaire is being developed for each employment sector and applicants to capture their challenges that will be the basis for the discussion at the JNG Summit that will include onsite and live streaming input. The JobsNotGuns Summit will provide a platform for potential employers to interact with District residents and training and support service providers that assist residents to qualify for employment and maintain sustainability once hired.  We will present a forecast of economic development initiatives planned or underway in the District of Columbia that will create employment and skill training opportunities for District residents.  

The JobsNotGuns Summit will provide applicants an overview of their responsibilities to participate in job training or support programs, as needed, to achieve and maintain employment that can lead to a career.  The goal of the JobsNotGuns Summit is to provide a platform to assist residents to obtain information regarding opportunities to earn a living, provide for their families and create a different lifestyle that will ultimately reduce the perpetrators and victims of gun violence.
